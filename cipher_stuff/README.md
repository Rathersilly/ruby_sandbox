# Status of this directory:

a.rb should encrypt something and save it to out2.txt
then c.rb should decrypt it
the key and iv are being transmitted ok but the encrypted
string is wonky as heck.
I've played around with encoding and got it all mostly fixed
except the encrypted string, so im getting 
wrong final block length errors
