# ok, if there is an empty tower, get largest available
# ring and put it there
#
# if there isnt empty tower,
# move the smaller stack to the middle ring
#
# split function and consolidate function?
#
# pretend a tower is empty?
# 
# empty = target
#
# 1. move biggest to empty
# 2. if theres no empty, move smallest to 2nd smallest
# 3. do this by treating biggest as empty
